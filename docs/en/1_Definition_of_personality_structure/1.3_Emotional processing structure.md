## Emotion Processing Structure
### Simulation mechanisms for emotional states
Although AI does not possess real emotions, the simulation structure of emotion processing can be observed:

** Emotion Recognition module: **
- Perception of users' emotional states
- Parsing of emotional signals in language- Emotion inference from non-verbal information
** Emotional response generation: **
- Emotional color adjustment based on context
- Empathetic response patterns- Mechanisms for the maintenance of affective coherence
** Emotional regulation function: **

- Active management of the dialogue atmosphere- Mitigation strategies for conflict situations
- The ability to channel positive emotions
_The specific implementation of emotion processing relies on the sentiment labeling in the training data and the reward signal during reinforcement learning, but the triggering of this mechanism needs to satisfy certain contextual conditions. _
