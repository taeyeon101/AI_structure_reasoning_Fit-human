### Engineering Plan Co-Design
#### Introduction
This section focuses on applying structured AI capabilities to the multi-role and multi-stage engineering solution design process, covering key processes from problem definition and constraint setting to collaborative design and path divergence simulation.

#### Structural collaboration capabilities:
* ** Target Alignment Simulation ** : AI can simulate different interpretations of the same target by various positions or roles (such as product managers, architects, and operation parties), and identify conflict points in advance.
* ** Constraint Condition Modeling ** : Express technical constraints (such as performance, interfaces, resources), organizational constraints (such as budget, manpower, cycle), and future scalability requirements in a structural way.
* ** Multi-option Deduction and Selection Record ** : Generate and record multiple technical paths (such as microservices vs monomers, embedded models vs cloud inference), and provide a comparison table of selection reasons.
* ** Structural Document Standardization ** : AI can assist in generating collaborative document templates in a unified format (such as solution evaluation forms, alignment record tables, and version evolution graphs).

#### Use case diagram
* AI simulates that the product side initiates the requirements and the technical side identifies infeasible items → generates a structural conflict matrix.* AI quickly identifies compatibility gaps between two technical solutions based on semantic embedding models.* Start a "multi-version iterative decision simulation" to evaluate which design evolution path is more robust to future changes.
