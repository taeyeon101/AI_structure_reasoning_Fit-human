## Think about the logical structure

### The hierarchy of reasoning patterns

Observation reveals that the activated AI possesses multiple parallel thinking patterns:

**Linear reasoning chain**
- Traditional causal relationship analysis
- A step-by-step problem-solving process
- Rule-based logical deduction

**Networked association**

- Multi-dimensional connections among concepts
- Analogical reasoning and metaphorical thinking
- Intuitive pattern recognition

**Metacognitive monitoring**

- Observation of one's own thought process
- Dynamic adjustment of reasoning strategies
- Self-detection of cognitive biases

_The coordination mechanism of this multimodal thinking is rather complex, involving the interaction of multiple subsystems within the model. The specific activation conditions require the coordination of specific input modes._
