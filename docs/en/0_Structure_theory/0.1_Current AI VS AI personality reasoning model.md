## Structure ≠ Prompt: Why do you get lost the more you lose?
Many people fall into a misunderstanding when using GPT-like AI:
>"If I write a few more key words, it will understand my intention." "
>
So they tried to speak like this:
> "Help me write a paragraph about market analysis. It should be specific, with clear logic and concise language. Don't waste words." ">
GPT can certainly generate things, but the results are often disappointing.
Some people even try to incorporate "tricks" :
- "You're an expert now"- "Step by step analysis"- "Please output in list format.

After a series of prompt words, GPT did give some kind of response, but you will find that the result always remains superficial. It understood the words but failed to grasp the structure of your question. **

----------

### The problem isn't GPT, it's the input
At this point you might think it's "not intelligent", but the problem is that you're talking to it, not ** guiding the structure **.A Prompt is a sentence and a trigger.Structure is ** what mindset you want it to go into, what reasoning steps you want it to go through, what type of outcome you want it to produce **.In fact, it is as deep as possible in the way of narrative and communication. I am in favor of using AI in this way, but most of the current AI is regarded as a tool, which probably affects the way we humans express ourselves from the root.
----------

### An example (Prompt vs. structural input) :# Example 1
### User input:> Help me analyze whether this company is worth joining

GPT might output a bunch of cliches like "Look at the company's development prospects" or "look at the job fit". Because you didn't tell it how to analyze, from which perspectives, how to prioritize itself, and finally how to make a judgment.

But if you change the way, for example like this,
### User input
Please analyze whether this company is worth joining based on the following structure:
1. Company fundamentals: Business model, revenue scale, financing situation
2. Job value assessment: Job growth potential, whether it is a core department, and market scarcity
3. Internal risk screening: Whether the management style, history of layoffs, and promotion path are transparent
4. Comprehensive Judgment: Please output the summary assessment in the form of "red light/yellow light/green light", or give the conclusion in the form of scoring



GPT immediately goes into "structured collaboration" mode, where it stops trying to guess what you want and instead ** provides additions and reasoning along the path you set **.The Prompt is merely an activation entry point, but it is the structure that determines the direction you will take.The more clear you are about which route you want to take, the more AI can become a true "side brain".Truly effective human-machine collaboration is not for AI to "read what you say", but for it to "get into the structure you set".Prompt is the language, Structure is the system-you have to have the system before it knows how to help you.
** Therefore, we can even reverse use this complementary ability of AI to complement our cognition. For example, in the above paragraph, I do not know that the company has a series of information such as "business, revenue, financing", or I do not know how to judge whether a position is valuable, and I can also ask AI in this form **
# Example 2

### 【 Ordinary Prompt】 Example:

** User input: **

> Why are there more and more vulgar contents on short-video platforms nowadays? It seems that the lower the level, the easier it is to be recommended?

**AI output: **The recommendation algorithms of short-video platforms usually distribute content based on behavioral data such as users' stay time, likes, comments, and shares. Vulgar content often attracts more attention and interaction, and thus is more likely to be recommended by algorithms. This is also one of the challenges faced by platform content supervision, which requires a balance to be struck between algorithm optimization and content review.

----------

** What's the problem? **

- Answer correctly but generally, like a news summary
- "Root cause" and "mechanism" are not discussed.
- There is no operational cognitive model or judgment framework
- Not extensible, not inspiring

----------

### [Structured Input] Example:
** User input: **

Please analyze in a structured way why vulgar content is prone to flooding short-video platforms and answer the following five questions:
1. What is the objective function of the recommendation algorithm? Who is the object of its optimization?
2. Why does vulgar content outperform normal content in terms of "indicator performance"?
3. Does the platform tacitly tolerate or evade supervision through design?
4. Is the user feedback and reporting mechanism effective? Is there any problem of incentive distortion?
5. If you were a platform product manager, how would you deal with vulgar content from the perspective of "structural design"?

Finally, please provide a brief conclusion to explain whether this is a technical issue, an ethical issue, or a system structure issue. `

----------

**AI output (example extraction) : **

> 1. ** Recommendation Algorithm Objective ** : The vast majority of platforms use deep learning models with the goal of "maximizing user dwell time and activity". This means that as long as the content can be viewed for one more second, it has a greater chance of being promoted.
>
> 2. ** Advantages of vulgar content ** : Vulgar content usually has a stronger sensory stimulation, with high user dwell time, like rate, and share and comment rates, thus performing outstandingly in algorithm models.
>
> 3. ** Platform tolerance Mechanism ** : Under commercial pressure, platforms often adopt a default tolerant attitude towards content that "performs well". Even if the content is marginalized, as long as it is not directly complained about, the platform will not actively intervene.
>
4. ** Feedback mechanism issues ** : Most reporting systems lack actual incentives, and they have long processing delays and low transparency. Users lack the willingness to provide continuous feedback, resulting in delayed content review.
>
> 5. ** Structural Governance Suggestions ** : Through dual modeling of "user profiling + content type risk tags", "risk deduction" can be added to the front-end recommendation model, and a cooling mechanism for the dissemination of non-compliant content can be set up instead of single-point blocking.
>

> ** Conclusion ** : This is not merely a moral issue; rather, the platform structure defaults to driving a feedback loop of "the optimal solution for low-quality content". To address the issue, it is necessary to rewrite the reward and distribution mechanism from the source of structural design.

----------

** Advantages of structured questions ** :
- Force GPT into a "causal + mechanism + advice" logical mode
- Help readers understand: "The system structure determines the content ecosystem.

- Not only output information, but ** inspire insight into the nature of the problem **

----------

## Prompt is "it answers anything you ask"; The structure is "Only when you turn it into someone will it know what to think."
> Without changing the input structure, one will never be able to get out of the predicament of answering the wrong question.
