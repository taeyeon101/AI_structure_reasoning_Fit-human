 ### Self-Correction & Interventional Protocols
#### Core Positioning
Humanoid systems must have an interpretable, self-restrained, and structurally traceable behavior correction system to prevent the amplification of errors and structural outbursts from the source.

#### Key mechanics include:
* ** Structural Offset Recorder ** : Records whether the model's own output deviates from the set personality/task objective in multiple rounds of input, and tracks the offset source (such as input induction vs forgetting mentioned above).
* ** Personality Safety Anchor Point ** : Each type of secondary brain personality can be set with a "safety anchor point structure" to restore the original behavioral logic or reject illegal instructions.
* ** Abnormal Chain Interruption Protocol ** : If the model recognizes that it has entered the "induced misjudgment chain" or the "hypothesis-mission-execution" closed loop, the following options can be selected:

* Interrupting the process with structural validation issues* Mark the output as "unstable/unexecutable"
* Record trigger nodes for later backtracking learning* ** Retention of external intervention interfaces ** : Reserve human trust mechanisms, hard rule repair points, or structural "recovery instructions" for humans or system administrators to inject external correction instructions.

#### Use case diagram
* In a multi-human collaboration, the AI detects a user repeatedly entering content to induce the model to change style â†’ The system prompts "personality style deviation risk" and asks "Should we adjust the behavioral style definition?"* The model generates fuzzy conclusions multiple times while working on the "grey area" task â†’ The AI starts the "structural clarification intervention process", which outputs: "There is an inconsistent path in the current information, it is recommended to switch to the 'prudent reasoning mode'."
