 ### Looped Error Regulation
#### Concept Note
Error loop control refers to the ability of AI to identify, mark, intervene and navigate when certain cognitive, executive or structural errors repeatedly occur in human-like input, thus avoiding falling into the vicious cycle of "human misguidance - model imitation - two-way error enhancement".

#### common error loop scenarios:

* The user mistakenly enters misleading logic (e.g., misinterpreting "latency" as "bandwidth issue") â†’ the AI learns to imitate â†’ misleads the user after multiple rounds.* There is implicit conflict logic in multi-person collaborative input â†’ AI can't prove the correct path â†’ Output ambiguous responses multiple times, increasing ambiguity.* User repeats input with "incomplete snippet" â†’ AI tries to complete but guesses direction shifts round by round.
#### Error control mechanism Design:
* ** Structural Error Fingerprint Library ** : AI builds a structural error template library based on the high-frequency error chains in historical tasks for pattern recognition.
* ** Multi-round Behavior Deviation Detector ** : AI analyzes whether the behavior trajectory gradually deviates from the original goal after each round of input (for example, solving Aâ†’ but getting stuck in questioning B).
* ** Interventional clarification mechanism ** : When the error loop is triggered, AI can raise structural clarification questions, such as "Do you mean the deployment layer or the functional layer by 'module'?"
* ** Self-Deviation Backtracking Module ** : The AI will record the nodes in its own behavior that may deviate from the consistent path and provide self-clarification prompts when triggered.

#### Use case diagram
* The user keeps repeating "Why isn't this model producing results?"â†’ AI detects 3 consecutive rounds of queries as repetitive structural errors â†’ Triggers a "clarifying branch" : Please confirm whether you want to know (1) the interface return time, or (2) the inference model activation state?* In human-like collaboration, the system detected "task goal understanding shifted at round 5" and proactively reminded: "Your current problem logic is inconsistent with the original input goal of 'improve collaboration efficiency'. Should we fix the context?"
