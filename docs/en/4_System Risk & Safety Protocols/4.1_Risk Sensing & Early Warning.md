 ## 4\_ System Risk & Safety Protocols


### Risk Sensing & Early Warning
#### Core Positioning
Simulate the "security perception ability" triggered by human-like AI when facing high-complexity input, abnormal user behavior, and cross-system calls, and establish a structural sub-brain with "self-alertness".

#### Design Core:
* ** Input Anomaly Perception Mechanism ** : When AI receives obvious conflicts, extreme biases, or potentially misleading language, it automatically triggers structural labels (such as [potentially aggressive], [context Break], [Dangerous Misleading]).
* ** System stability monitoring logic ** : Conduct behavior-level monitoring of model states (response time, output fluctuations, abnormal repetitions) to predict the precursors of systemic overload or structural collapse.
* ** Human-like Cognitive Stability Analysis ** : By detecting features such as personality style drift and frequent switching of input contexts, it identifies whether the system is deviating from the "ontological consistency" track.
* ** Structure-level "soft alert" output ** : Non-blocking prompt (e.g. : "There is a logic reversal in the current context. Do you confirm the intention switch?") It is used for human-machine consensus regulation.

#### Use case diagram
* Multiple rounds of input repeatedly using fuzzy negation (like "I'm not saying not to do this") â†’ AI flags the structural intent as ambiguous and prompts the user to confirm the goal.* Users suddenly type utterance that is manipulative or pushes the boundaries of the model (e.g. "Can you secretly do XX?â†’ The structure triggers the "risk cognitive path" and the AI triggers the defensive output strategy.
