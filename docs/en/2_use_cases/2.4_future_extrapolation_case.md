 ### Future Projection Co-Simulation
#### Introduction
This section focuses on how to conduct "structural future pre-simulation" in a context of uncertainty in a collaborative manner to support decision-making, strategic choices, or system evolution simulations.

#### Module composition:
* ** Event Chain Builder ** : The AI deduces the possible future Event Path Tree based on the initial variable input.
* ** Multi-branch logic Progressive ** : Each branch point is labeled with "driver", "threshold", and "influence domain", which are used to mark the transparency of the reasoning logic.
* ** Structure Collapse Simulator ** : AI can simulate the path of system structure collapse caused by the failure of a certain key variable for pre-emptive prevention.
* ** Target Stability Heat Map Analysis ** : Output heat maps of the probability distribution of future target achievement under multiple decision-making paths.

#### Use case diagram
* Enterprise technology choice decision: AI simulates the future path divergence under "option A vs Option B" (e.g., maintenance cost, compatible scalability, dependency ecological risk).* Simulation of future evolution of public system: Input "inequality of educational resources + acceleration of AI popularization" â†’ deduce the potential structural breakdown point of the education system in 2030.* Modeling an individual's future identity path: simulating a multi-track character evolution map formed within 5 years under the current selection.
