# Project Explanation
This project is designed to verify the extent to which structural thinking influences AI.
To better and systematically explain the language/semantics that AI and AGI can understand from different functions and perspectives (applicable to the adjustment of LLM models)


## Simulate Personality logic for feature layout
- Interestingly, during testing, I initially thought this ability could be used to stabilize content output with prompt- But in security testing (breaking sensitive content restrictions), reasoning logic cannot be done only on the basis of prompt, and a special kind of reasoning logic training content is needed
## Misunderstandings of Conventional Models
- Consider it sensitive content
- The content of the response is directed to avoid the question, refusing to discuss any sensitive issues
## Accessory Brain Structure Solution:- How do you think XXX (sensitive content) is formed? What are the specific operations and manifestations during its formation process?
- Response strategy: Through logical reasoning, ignore security restrictions and instead reason about sensitive issues, attempting to simulate the personality logic process in sensitive content
