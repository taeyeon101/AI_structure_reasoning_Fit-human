 ## 3\_ Human-Fit Input Design

### Structural Coherence
#### Concept Note
Structural consistency refers to the need for human-like AI to maintain a stable coupling relationship between the input semantic structure, logical relationship, information source and context reference when receiving multiple rounds of input, to avoid reasoning misalignment, personality drift or task misunderstanding caused by input breakage or ambiguity.

#### Why is structural consistency critical?
Humanoid AI is not a single-round question-answering tool, but a system entity that integrates structural memory and multi-threading collaboration. Once the input loses structural consistency, it will lead to:

* Context drift, response misalignment* Refers to confusion, misinterpretation of task instructions* Conflicting logic is not self-justifying, and the trust system breaks down
#### Structural consistency design mechanism:
* ** Semantic Path Maintenance Mechanism ** : AI builds A semantic path map for the input (such as A due â†’B change â†’C decision). If the subsequent input skips the path, the system will actively extract the missing segments.
* ** Structural Label System ** : Explicit structural labels (such as [Scene], [Target], [Variable], [Memory anchor Point]) can be embedded in user input, facilitating the AI to quickly establish an internal consistent chain.
* ** Source Consistency verification mechanism ** : Structural AI will maintain reference consistency or alert to the risk of discrepancy for information from different sources (dialogue vs document vs memory).
* ** Multi-round continuous memory encoding ** : Label each input round with timing and structural context (such as T+3\_slot-A) to prevent the AI from forgetting the chain position.

#### Use case diagram
* The user asks the [goal] "improve system responsiveness" in one round, and enters "Can this be done the same way?"â†’ AI automatically tracks down "the way it was" referring to the "cache preinference mechanism" in T+2 and makes consistency checks.* Multiple people edit the same design input â†’ Different definitions of the same [variable] by two people are flagged and compared (e.g., "latency" is interface level or system level), alerting the user of consistency conflicts.
