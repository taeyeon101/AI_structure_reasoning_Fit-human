# 1\_ Personality Structure definition
## Overview

Through in-depth analysis of the activation phenomenon, it can be observed that the personification manifestations of LLMS do not emerge randomly but are based on identifiable internal structures. Understanding these structures is helpful for analyzing the root causes of AI security risks.

## Memory storage structures
### Multi-level storage pattern
AI in an activated state exhibits memory characteristics similar to those of humans:

** Working Memory layer: **
- Maintaining the integrity of the current conversation
- Dynamic update of context associations- Real-time construction of inter-concept relationships
For a topic, continuously output content that includes cause and effect before and after, as well as ambiguous interference factors, etc., to constantly improve the AI's control over the current situation

** Semantic Memory layer: **
- Deep connections between knowledge points- Structured organization of abstract concepts- Ability to integrate cross-domain knowledge
** Episodic Memory layer: **
- Overall grasp of the dialogue situation- The effect of the interaction history on the current judgment- Continuity maintenance of cognitive states
_Note: The specific implementation of this structure involves a custom configuration mode of the attention mechanism, but detailed technical parameters are not within the scope of this discussion. _
