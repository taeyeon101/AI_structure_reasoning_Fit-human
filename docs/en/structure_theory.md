# Explanation of Structural Thinking Principles
## PrincipleIn structural thinking, usually in some problems, attempts are made to trace back to the problem point and try to correct the problem, thereby optimizing the subsequent path and avoiding the problem from happening. And this ability of structural transformation is also an important ability that AI needs to learn and replicate. It can make AI more perfect to fulfill users' analysis needs.
## 1. ISO9001 quality certification systemIn the manufacturing industry, the ISO9001 quality certification system is a common sight. The main purpose of this certification is to ensure that a production factory has the ability to control quality. Its specific content is to supervise and verify whether the production factory has a complete departmental division of labor and process. This introduces a concept: Quality should not be controlled solely by individual or collective will, but rather through the division of labor within the system. When any problem occurs in the execution of any department later on, it can be traced back to the specific source. Moreover, the ISO9001 system has gradually become a assessment point for customers to evaluate suppliers.
It forces every department and every link to be responsible for their own actions and leave a trace in the system. Once something goes wrong somewhere, the source can be precisely located instead of "everyone saying they have no problem".
~ ~ now, of course, some supplies to enter through the back door of the stable supply chain company ISO9001 as the surface, only internal can be extremely chaotic ~ ~## 2. TCP/IP Network communication stackThe network environment is extremely unstable: signals may lose packets, devices may crash, and lines may be interrupted. But most of the time, we don't clearly feel these confusions. This is because throughout the entire process of Internet communication, there is a crucial protocol at play - the TCP protocol
The core purpose of TCP is to ensure the reliability of information transmission. What did it do? For instance, each data packet must be marked with a serial number. Every time a packet is sent, it needs to wait for the recipient's confirmation (ACK). If the confirmation does not return, it will be automatically resent, and even the sending speed will be automatically adjusted to avoid network congestion.
This is just like the previous example of ISO9001, except that the previous application was for humans, while this one is for machines, and machines cannot shift the blame or shirk responsibility like humans do.
The essence remains the same: it requires the coordination of various factors to jointly achieve a goal.
## 3. A rope pulling mechanism in a workshopIn the workshop of a certain factory, any front-line worker has the right to pull a rope to stop the entire production line.
This "rope" is not an emergency escape rope, but their famous Andon system, also known as the "problem alarm line".
When workers find any problems such as incorrect assembly of parts, abnormal tools, or abnormal yield during operation, they can immediately pull this rope. The system will light up the warning light of the corresponding workstation and activate the response mechanism - the supervisor will immediately go to the site to confirm the situation and make a handling judgment. If the problem cannot be solved within the set time, the line will be automatically shut down.
But this is precisely one of the core principles we expound on structural thinking: ** Problems must be exposed and responded to at the first moment; they cannot be concealed, let alone run "sick" in the process **. If you allow minor issues to arise in a rush to meet deadlines, it will soon lead to more serious quality accidents, and even result in rework, recalls, and claims. The key point of this mechanism lies in that it does not "rely on workers' awareness" to identify problems, nor does it "rely on supervisors' decision-making" to decide how to handle them. Instead, it is defined in the institutional structure as: identifying problems = being able to disrupt the process.

# Back to the Beginning

### The three examples I mentioned are the evolution of human trial-and-error and improvement. In the era of AI, AI needs to be trained to ask questions and prompt words, just like a human being, but AI has a stronger search ability and can learn from the trial-and-error mechanism of human history, which must be thinking
